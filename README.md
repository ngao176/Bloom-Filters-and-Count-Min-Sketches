# Bloom-Filters-and-Count-Min-Sketches
Bloom filter, which is a probabilistic data structure that never has false negatives, but that may have false positives. The file called BloomFilter.cpp that contains initial steps towards implementing a Bloom filter. 


Count-Min Sketch, which is a probabilistic data structure that may overestimate the count, but that will never underestimate our count. The file called CountMinSketch.cpp that contains initial steps towards implementing a Count-Min Sketch
